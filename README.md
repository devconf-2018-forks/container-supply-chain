Supply Chain Demo
======================================

Manual Usage (Docker)
-----
This repository is meant to demonstrate a software supply chain that provides best practices for operations teams looking to  adopt containers in a production environment. 

Deeper explaination will be followed up in a blog entry, but a technical person should be able to look at these docs and understand how to implement a sane container software supply chain. This particular implementation uses a Red Hat stack but these concepts apply equally to Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS or Fedora. 

To build all images:
```
make
```

To tag the latest built images as production:
```
make tag_production
```

TBD: To push the lastest production images into a registry server:
```
make push
```

Automated Usage (OpenShift Single Project)
-----------
Build the supply chain:
```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/fatherlinux/container-supply-chain.git
cd ~/container-supply-chain/
oc project operations
oc create -f AutomaticSupplyChain.yaml
```

Watch the Builds Complete:
```
oc get builds
```


Advanced Automated Usage (OpenShift Multiple Project)
-----------
Create development and operations projects:
```
oc new-project operations
oc new-project development
```

Grant user access to do supply chain build. This is so we can watch the builds in the web interface:
```
oadm policy add-role-to-user admin admin -n development
oadm policy add-role-to-user admin admin -n operations
oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:development -n operations
```

Build the supply chain:
```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/fatherlinux/container-supply-chain.git
cd ~/container-supply-chain/
oc project operations
oc create -f AutomaticSupplyChain.yaml
```

Watch the Builds Complete:
```
oc get builds
```



Now create an example application built on the secure supply chain (RHEL + RHSCL)
```
git clone https://github.com/fatherlinux/wordpress-demo
cd ~/wordpress-demo/
git checkout demo03
```


Create the application:
```
oc project development
./create.sh wordpress-objects.yaml
```

Bring up the site in the web interface:
```
wpfrontend-wordpress.apps.example.com
```

Looks the same as the one you would pull from DockerHub, thatâ€™s good, makes it easy to use:


Now add a regular user, so that you can watch the deployments in the web interface:
```
oadm policy add-role-to-user edit fatherlinux -n wordpress
```

Trigger a build and watch the deploy happen automatically in a different project:


Directories
-----------

* corebuild: Corebuild which does initial yum installs and updates from upstream Red Hat Engineering. This core build would typically be execute by the operations team and saved in an enterprise registry locally within a company.

* httpd-php: Middleware layer, built upon rhel7-crunchtools core build, which installs and configures Apache 2.4 and PHP 5.6 from the Red Hat Software Collections. This set of software is built to work together using the modern FPM/FastCGI technology and Apache's MPM event driven main loop.

* wordpress: Middleware layer, built upong crunchtools-httpd24-php56, which installs wordpress using a similar methodology as the Official image on DockerHub. The advantage of this build is it constructed on a completely trusted software supply chain.
